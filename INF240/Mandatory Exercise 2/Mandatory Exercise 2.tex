\section{Computer Problem 14, Chapter 6}
There are three users with pairwise relatively prime moduli $n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}$.
Suppose that their encryption exponents are all $e = 3$. The same message \emph{m} is sent to each of them and 
you intercept the ciphertexts $c_{i} \equiv m^{3}(mod$ $n_{i})$ for \emph{i} = 1,2,3.

\subsection{A)}
\label{a}
Show that $0 \leq m^{3} < n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}$

\emph{Solution:}\\
$m < n_{1},n_{2},n_{3} \rightarrow{m^{3} < n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}}$

\subsection{B)}
\label{b}
Show how to use the Chinese remainder theorem to find $m^{3}$ (as an exact integer, \emph{not} only as 
$m^{3} (mod$ $n_{1}n_{2}n_{3})$) and therefore \emph{m}.
Do this without factoring

\emph{Solution:}\\
We setup the problem as a system of linear congruences:

$c_{1} \equiv m^{3}(mod$ $n_{1})$\\
$c_{2} \equiv m^{3}(mod$ $n_{2})$\\
$c_{3} \equiv m^{3}(mod$ $n_{3})$\\

This can be written as:\\
$m^{3} \equiv c_{1}(mod$ $n_{1})$\\
$m^{3} \equiv c_{2}(mod$ $n_{2})$\\
$m^{3} \equiv c_{3}(mod$ $n_{3})$\\

By Chinese Remainder Theorem there exists one unique solution.\\
From \ref{a} we know that $m < n_{1},n_{2},n_{3}$ and $m^{3} < n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}$.\\
We can thus find $m$ by taking the cube root of $m^{3}$.
$m = \sqrt[3]{m^{3}}$

\newpage
\subsection{C)}
Suppose that\\
$n_{1} = 2469247531693,$ $n_{2} = 11111502225583,$ $n_{3} = 44444222221411$\\
and the corresponding ciphertexts are:\\
359335245251, 10436363975495, 5135984059593.

These were all encrypted using $e = 3$. Find the message.

\emph{Solution:}\\
Solve the system of congruences from \ref{b} using CRT to obtain $m^{3}$. I used the algorithm described on page 108, problem 24 in our book to solve it.\\
First we compute the product of $n_{1}n_{2}n_{3} = 1219418322585514865441452950268831928809$\\
Then we obtain the values $z_{i}$ by computing $(n_{1}n_{2}n_{3})/n_{i}$ for $i=1$ to 3.\\
Afterwards we compute the multiplicative inverse of $y_{i} = z_{i}$ mod $n_{i}$ for $i=1$ to 3\\
Lastly we sum together $a_{i}*y_{i}*z_{i}$ for $i=1$ to 3 and reduce modulo ($n_{1}n_{2}n_{3}$), this is $m^{3}$\\
$m^{3} = 521895811536685104609613375$\\
$m = \sqrt[3]{m^{3}} = \sqrt[3]{521895811536685104609613375} = 805121215$\\
Replace each pair of numbers (08, 05, 12...) with the english letter at that position, where a = 01, b = 02... to find the decrypted message\\
Decrypted message = hello\\
